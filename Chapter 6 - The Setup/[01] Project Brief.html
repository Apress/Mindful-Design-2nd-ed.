<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Daily journaling is a powerful and often therapeutic tool for
individuals, and especially useful to people with neurodevelopmental
issues or mental health struggles. However, the modern landscape of
daily journaling, task-tracking, and note-taking tools is rooted in
productivity tooling such as Trello and note-taking or documentation
apps like Notion. These are not fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Daytime is a digital journal with a twist: providing an infinite
canvas journal for folks who need autonomy and creativity over their
daily journal layouts and flexibility in what they track. Daytime brings
the customisability and autonomy of a typical analogue bullet journal
together with the composability and predictability of modern digital
tooling.</p>
<h2 id="expected-users">Expected Users</h2>
<ul>
<li>People who use analogue journal methods looking to switch to a
digital solution.</li>
<li>People who want to journal but prefer digital soltuions.</li>
<li>People who use industry-standard productivity tools like Notion but
want more autonomy and customization options.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The primary goal of this project is to research, conceptualize, and
design a user-friendly and feature-rich journaling app within a six-week
timeframe. ### Research Phase (Weeks 1-2): - Conduct generative and
descriptive research to understand how people currently journal -
Analyze existing journaling apps to identify strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats in the market. - Define user personas and
create user empathy maps to visualize the ideal user experience. -
Document key insights and findings from the research phase.</p>
<h3 id="conceptualization-weeks-3-4">Conceptualization (Weeks 3-4):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brainstorm and ideate on unique features that differentiate the app
from existing solutions.</li>
<li>Create wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes to visualize the app’s
structure and flow.</li>
<li>Develop a feature set and prioritize them based on user needs and
technical feasibility.</li>
<li>Conduct usability testing on prototypes to gather initial feedback
for refinement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-phase-weeks-5-6">Design Phase (Weeks 5-6):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Develop high-fidelity prototypes incorporating feedback from
usability testing.</li>
<li>Create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface design.</li>
<li>Implement user feedback from the evaluative research and user
testing.</li>
<li>Develop basic design system guidelines and prepare components for
development.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenges-and-questions">Challenges and questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>We need to ensure we’re building the right thing, tight feedback and
testing loops will be essential.</li>
<li>The six-week time constraint means we’ll need to move quickly, while
still applying rigor.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="success-criteria">Success Criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li>Positive feedback from usability testing at each phase.</li>
<li>Completion of research, conceptualization, and design phases within
the designated timeline.</li>
<li>Approval of the final design from stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
