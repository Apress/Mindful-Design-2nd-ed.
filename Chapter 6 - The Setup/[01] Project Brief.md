# Project Brief
## Abstract
Daily journaling is a powerful and often therapeutic tool for individuals, and especially useful to people with neurodevelopmental issues or mental health struggles. However, the modern landscape of daily journaling, task-tracking, and note-taking tools is rooted in productivity tooling such as Trello and note-taking or documentation apps like Notion. These are not fit for purpose.

Daytime is a digital journal with a twist: providing an infinite canvas journal for folks who need autonomy and creativity over their daily journal layouts and flexibility in what they track. Daytime brings the customisability and autonomy of a typical analogue bullet journal together with the composability and predictability of modern digital tooling.

## Expected Users
- People who use analogue journal methods looking to switch to a digital solution.
- People who want to journal but prefer digital soltuions.
- People who use industry-standard productivity tools like Notion but want more autonomy and customization options.

## Scope
The primary goal of this project is to research, conceptualize, and design a user-friendly and feature-rich journaling app within a six-week timeframe.
### Research Phase (Weeks 1-2):
- Conduct generative and descriptive research to understand how people currently journal
- Analyze existing journaling apps to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the market.
- Define user personas and create user empathy maps to visualize the ideal user experience.
- Document key insights and findings from the research phase.

### Conceptualization (Weeks 3-4):
- Brainstorm and ideate on unique features that differentiate the app from existing solutions.
- Create wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes to visualize the app's structure and flow.
- Develop a feature set and prioritize them based on user needs and technical feasibility.
- Conduct usability testing on prototypes to gather initial feedback for refinement.

### Design Phase (Weeks 5-6):
- Develop high-fidelity prototypes incorporating feedback from usability testing.
- Create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface design.
- Implement user feedback from the evaluative research and user testing.
- Develop basic design system guidelines and prepare components for development.

## Challenges and questions
- We need to ensure we're building the right thing, tight feedback and testing loops will be essential.
- The six-week time constraint means we'll need to move quickly, while still applying rigor.

## Success Criteria
- Positive feedback from usability testing at each phase.
- Completion of research, conceptualization, and design phases within the designated timeline.
- Approval of the final design from stakeholders.
