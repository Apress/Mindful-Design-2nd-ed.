# Daytime Research Brief
## Abstract
This research initiative aims to understand the needs, preferences, and challenges of individuals who engage in journaling activities. By conducting ethnographic interviews, the study seeks to gather valuable insights from a diverse range of participants, including both conventional journal-keepers and those who identify as neurodivergent. The findings will inform the design process of a new journaling app that caters to a broad spectrum of users.

## Goals and Objectives
- **Goal 1:** To identify the motivations, habits, and pain points of individuals who currently engage in journaling.
- **Goal 2:** To gain insights into the diverse needs of neurodivergent individuals in the context of journaling.
- **Objective 1:** Conduct ethnographic interviews with a minimum of 30 participants to understand their journaling practices.
- **Objective 2:** Ensure a diverse and representative sample of neurodivergent participants in the study.
- **Objective 3:** Analyze and synthesize data to inform the design of a user-friendly and inclusive journaling app.

## Methodology
Ethnographic interviews will be the primary research method, involving open-ended questions and interactive discussions. Participants will be encouraged to share their journaling habits, preferences, and challenges. The interviews will be conducted remotely to accommodate participants' preferences and ensure a broader geographic representation.

## Participant Criteria
- **Conventional Journal-Keepers:** Individuals who actively engage in journaling, regardless of the medium (e.g., physical notebooks, digital platforms).
- **Neurodivergent Individuals:** To ensure a comprehensive understanding, we seek participants who identify as neurodivergent, including but not limited to individuals with ADHD, autism, and other neurodivergent conditions.
- **Diversity:** Participants will be selected to represent a diverse range of demographics, including age, gender, cultural background, and geographic location.

## Budget:
A budget of $1,000 is allocated for participant incentives.
